# Polygrain microstructure generation through Voronoi Tessellation
### This code includes
#### 1) Randomly generated the location of points. 
#### 2) Perform Voronoi tessellation based on the location of generated points.
#### 3) Add boundaries to the generated domain

### How to use the code
```
python voronoi.py
```
### Generated 2D polygrain microstructure examples
#### 1) With periodic boundary condition
#### 2) Without periodic boundary condition
