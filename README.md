# Polygrain microstructure generation through Voronoi Tessellation
### This code includes
1) Randomly generates the location of points. 
2) Perform Voronoi tessellation based on the location of generated points.
3) Add boundaries to the generated domain

### How to use the code
```
python voronoi.py
```
### Generated 2D polygrain microstructure examples
1) With periodic boundary condition

2) Without periodic boundary condition
